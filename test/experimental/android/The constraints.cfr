[125 < Screen.price + ... + < 175 ]

//The objective functions:
13. Minize the cost of all the hardware
[ Min(price, sum(Screen, Keyboard, Battery, CPU...Front-Camera))]

15. Maximize the times of performance.improved.
[ Max(Num(performance.improved))]

16. Minimize the times of energyConsumption.increased
[ Min(Num(energyConsumption.increased))]


//The ROM
//The Feature
//The Applications
1. Only choose the systems apps that need less than 200MB ROM for the installation and 100MB ROM for the user data.
[ SystemApplication.installationROM < 200 && Application.ROM.userDataROM <100 ]


2. The ROM that one APP needs cannot exceed 20MB.
[ Application.installationROM < 20 ]

2. The RAM that one system app needs cannot exceed 20MB.
[ SystemApplication.vmRAM < 20 ]

3. If the app can run in the background, the vmRAM this app needs is cannot exceed 30MB.
[ Application.backgroundRunning  => Application.vmRAM 30 ]

4. Only install the highly stable apps. (for the vendor)
[ Application.Stability = high] 

5. Do not install any user apps whose the energy consumption index is more than 20.
[ UserApplication.energyConsumptionIndex  <20 ]

6.If the user app has high rank (4-5) in the android market, choose the one, even if it is not stable and may consume more energy (more than 40).
[UserApplication.Stability.low || UserApplication.Stability.medium || UserApplication.eneryConsumptionIndex > 40 => UserApplication.Usability.U_4-5]

//(UserApplication.Usability.U_4-5) 0.95
//(UserApplication.Stability.high && (UserApplication.eneryConsumptionIndex <= 40) 0.9
