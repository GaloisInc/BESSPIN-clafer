Sublime Text 2
--------------

We provide a build system configuration. 
Use `<CTRL>+B` to compile a Clafer `.cfr` file. 
This build system assumes that Clafer executable is in system `PATH` and is automatically selected for files with extension `.cfr`.

### Installation 

Copy `Packages\User\clafer.sublime-build` into your home directory Sublime Text 2 folder.

> Note: on Windows 7 and 8, the folder is `<user name>\AppData\Roaming\Sublime Text 2\Packages\User`.
