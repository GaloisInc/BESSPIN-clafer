Sublime Text 2
--------------

We provide a build system configuration. 

### Usage

Use `<CTRL>+B` to compile a Clafer `.cfr` file. 
This build system assumes that Clafer executable is in system `PATH` and is automatically selected for files with extension `.cfr`.

### Installation 

1. Copy the folder `User` from `IDEs\sublime-text-2\Packages` to the folder `Packages` in Sublime Text 2 folder inside your home directory.

> Note: 
> on Windows 7 and 8, the folder is `<user name>\AppData\Roaming\Sublime Text 2\Packages`.
> on Mac, the folder is `~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/Packages`
